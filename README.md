< Summary >

Equal distribution is critical to the success in any kind of group sports. Strategies are analyzed to find out the most influential attributor towards achieving the victory of a game. The objective of this project is to investigate the iconic e-sport game dataset with defined attributes of the victory such that the determinants of game victory are identified. 

Thus, we are proposing to analyze the gameplay dataset from “League of Legends Ranked Games” to identify the better approach towards improving the win ratio.

< Introduction(Background) >

As a rising industry, e-sport is categorized as group sports because of the competitiveness and similarity compared to traditional group sports, such as basketball. Multiplayer online battle arena (Moba) games are drawing rising attention. With the development of the entire e-sport industry, millions of dollars have been invested in this industry, in terms of contract signing and competition setting.  Researches and analyses have been made to strategize the gameplay as a teamsport towards winning competitions.

Teams without obvious short-boards are ranked higher and expected having a higher win rate. Meanwhile, talented player is rarely explored in video games. With outstanding gameplays and game-understanding, stars being identified when leading teams to win the match. Is it necessary to have an outstanding leader in the team to win the match over an average team? In other words, is gathering majority of game resources to the teamstar leading to a higher win rate than team members with equal distributions do? 

< Work Plan/Methodology >

Design a model to evaluate the evenness of team members’ game statistics, with match data as input.
Write a python program to complete the model calculation, including working out variance of certain data of a team, etc.
Identify the correlation between win/loss and the model output of a team, using statistics.


< Scope >
 
Obtain the most-win team type classified by performance variance.
 
< Timeframe >
 
Phase One: Model design (9/26 - 10/3)

Phase Two: Data cleaning, programming and debug (10/3 - 10/24)

Phase Three: Edit report (10/24 - 10/31)
